# YouTube Clone Project

# Overview of its purpose 
This project is an attempt of using intermediate HTML and CSS skills I learned and as a result apply it to build a replica of the website, YouTube.com, which I use in a daily basis as a medium to not only be entertained, but also to be informed and educated with. 

# Features used in development of the project 
By building the frontend of the main page of YouTube really allowed me to apply the newly learnt skills using HTML and CSS. Below are examples of the things I used to build this project:
- buttons 
- spans 
- divs 
- classes
- transitions 
- nested flexbox
- css grids 
- relative and absolute positions
- plethora of CSS styling tools 
- frequent use of GitHub to keep track of the changes I made 

# Challenges faced during the project
Though through applying freshly learnt content to build this project I had learnt quite a few things, I came across a lot of bugs and styling issues that really pushed me to my limits. Below are just some things I came across that challenged me:
- Using flexbox in a nested manner 
- So much HTML code and a lack of organisation made it hard to read 
- Making sure the style was as close as possible to the actual website 
- using absolute and relative positions to form the notification count and time stamps was a bit hard to understand since I am a beginner 

Even though encountered quite a few challenges I invested the time in it and it paid off. I can say this has been quite a positive learning experience and I can't wait to do more front-end projects!
